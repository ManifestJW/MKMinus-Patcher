# MKMinus-Patcher
Patches Mario Kart Wii with my mod Mario Kart Minus

Having Git installed on your computer is a prerequisite for the auto-updater.

Run Update.bat before patching **every time**

Drag And Drop A **Vanilla** Mario Kart Wii iso onto the .bat file. Output ISO will appear in the out folder

There is one file you need to install from Google Drive because it's too big to fit on github. Put it inside Patches\Minus\sound
